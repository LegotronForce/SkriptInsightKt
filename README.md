SkriptInsightKt is an **experimental** open-source parser and a linter for [Skript](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript). It works by reading the code written by a user and analysing it to provide a rich editing experience for Skript users.



## Goals

The goal of this project is to experiment with faster ways of parsing Skript and might replace the official code over on [SkriptInsight](https://github.com/SkriptInsight/SkriptInsight).

This project is also focusing on predictive approaches to code-completion and control flow analysis.



## Development

All development will be done fully open from the start. This means that everyone will be able to access the code from the beginning.
